# What is this?
Autonomous guard robot that walks the perimeter of the house in search of intruding cats. When it detects an unidentified cat,  proceeds to shoot water in order in order to expel him from the house.

It has two operating modes, the automatic mode, where the robot patrols on its own and will shoot if it finds an intruding cat and the manual mode, where thanks to a complementary app the owner will be notified with a photo of the detection of a cat in real time, being able to decide whether to shoot or not. This mode is very useful for homes where they have cats as pets.

# Requeriments

To run the code it's needed:

- [Python 3.10.x](https://www.python.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [RPi.GPIO](https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/)
- [Multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html)
- [Pyrebase](https://pypi.org/project/Pyrebase/)

Also for the Companion App it's needed:

# Hardware Scheme
Next we can see the HW Scheme of the robot, including the components:

# 3D Pieces
For the correct operation of the robot, it has been necessary to generate the following 3d pieces:
### Robot chassis
